# AngryPsychology
Brief description of the Angry Psychology project  

The idea of the project was born a long time ago — as a response to toxic positivity and superficial advice in the spirit of "Just calm down." I wanted to create a space where anger and hyper-commitment are studied honestly, scientifically and without embellishment.  

But there was a barrier: there were not enough skills in web development to realize what was planned — a dynamic website with tests, interactive tools and provocative design. Instead of banal articles about "breathing techniques," I saw rage rooms in numbers, sarcastic response generators, and diaries for "anger training."  

Now, having learned about The Odin Project, the project will finally take shape by the end of the training. It will be not just a website, but an anti-psychology for those who are tired of sugary advice. They teach here:  
- Evil — to channel aggression into energy.  
- The good ones are to defend borders without feeling guilty.  

Without programming, but with a rigorous scientific base and a provocative style.  

Philosophy: "It's okay to be angry. Being kind doesn't mean being a wimp. Will we figure it out?"
